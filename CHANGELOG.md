Hey! Big update after a year of silence 😅

The entire project has been rebuilt from the ground up:

- 🔧 Complete rewrite – new codebase, better performance
- 👤 User accounts – save custom recipe lists across devices
- 🔍 Improved duplicate detection – better matching of tags and ingredients
- 💾 Saved shopping lists – save and load your lists anytime
- 🖨️ Print views – multiple display options for your shopping list
- 🌍 Full localization – UI now translated in all supported languages (not just DE/EN anymore)
- 🌙 Dark mode
- 📲 Bring app export – send your shopping list directly to Bring
- 🛒 Mini cart – see selected recipes while browsing

...and tons of smaller improvements and bug fixes along the way.

Source code is still public on GitHub if you're curious 👀

Feedback always welcome! 🙏
